Here is a **brief explanation of your project concepts**

## 💖 Project Concept — Valentine Page for Mom

This project is a simple Valentine’s Day webpage created to express love and gratitude to a mother. It uses core frontend technologies to design an interactive and emotional digital greeting.

## 🧱 Core Concepts Used

### 🌐 HTML — Structure

HTML is used to create the layout and content of the webpage:

* Page heading (Hi Mom ❤️)
* Loving message text
* Heart element
* Surprise button
* Hidden message container

It defines the structure of the Valentine card.

### 🎨 CSS — Styling & Animation

CSS is used to make the page visually attractive:

* Soft romantic gradient background
* Centered card layout
* Rounded corners and shadows
* Custom heart shape using CSS
* Beating heart animation using keyframes
* Styled button

This creates the emotional and aesthetic feel of the page 💗

### ❤️ CSS Shape Design

The heart is created using pure CSS:

* A rotated square
* Two circular pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`)
* Combined to form a heart shape
* Animated with scale transform

### ⚡ JavaScript — Interactivity

JavaScript adds dynamic behavior:

* Detects button click
* Shows a hidden surprise card
* Displays an emotional Tamil message
* Uses DOM manipulation
* Toggles visibility with animation

This makes the page interactive 🎁

### 🪄 DOM Manipulation

The script dynamically:

* Finds the button element
* Creates the surprise card if not present
* Inserts it into the page
* Controls show/hide behavior

### 🎯 User Experience Concept

The project focuses on:

* Emotional connection
* Simplicity
* Visual appeal
* Surprise interaction
Clean beginner-friendly design
